# Udoo Image Creator 20.04
> Script for the creation of an Ubuntu 20.04 for the UDOO Neo SBC.

This script uses debootstrap to create a minimal Ubuntu 20.04 rootfs then it configures it to make it compatible with the UDOO neo board. It uses a pre-compiled 4.14 kernel and u-boot.

sudo ./udoo_image_create_v2.sh
